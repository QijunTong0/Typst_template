This article provides a brief introduction to *axiomatic quantum physics*, which is founded on three core axioms.

First, we recall that a physical system is described by its state—a mathematical entity—and its time evolution, which is typically governed by a differential equation. In classical physics, the state is defined by generalized coordinates $q=(q_1,...,q_f)$ and their corresponding generalized momenta $p=(p_1,...,p_f)$. Then the time evolution is determined by *Hamilton function* and *Hamilton's canonical equation*.\
We give the definition of the state of a quantum system as following axiom.
#axiom[The *state* of a quantum system is represented by a unit vector (referred to as the *state vector*) in a complex Hilbert space $cal(H)$.
  For any state vector $psi in cal(H)$ and any complex number $alpha$ with absolute value 1, the vectors $psi$ and $alpha psi$ represent the same physical state.]

#axiom[Any observable physical quantity is represented by a self-adjoint operator on $cal(H)$.]

*Remark*: Self-adjoint operators are used because their eigenvalues, which correspond to the possible measurement outcomes of a physical quantity, are always real numbers. \
An observable quantity $T$ of a state $psi in cal(H)$ in quantum physics is stochastic. Then we define a random variable $T_psi.$ Here we add an axiom for $T_psi$ on a probability space$(Omega,cal(B)(bb(R)),P).$
#axiom[Let $B in cal(B)(bb(R))$, then $P(T_psi in B)=||E_T(B) psi||^2$, where $E_T$ is the spectral measure of $T$.
]
Then we obtain the following useful thoerem.
#theorem[The expectation value of the random variable $T_psi$ is given by $E[T_psi] = angle.l psi, T psi angle.r$.]
#proof[
  Let $P_T_psi$ the probability distribution of $T_psi.$

  $E[T_psi]=
  &integral_bb(R) lambda d P_T_psi (lambda)\
  &=integral lambda d||E_T(B) psi||^2\
  &=integral_bb(R)lambda d angle.l E_T(B)psi,E_T(B)psi angle.r \
  &=integral_bb(R)lambda d angle.l psi,E_T(B)^2psi angle.r because "adjoint operator"\
  &=integral_bb(R)d angle.l psi,lambda E_T(B)psi angle.r because "projection oprerator"\
  &=angle.l psi,T psi angle.r because "spectral measure"$
